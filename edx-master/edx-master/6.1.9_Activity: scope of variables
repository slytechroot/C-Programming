Activity: scope of variables

1)
Suppose you have defined a function add as follows:

int add (int a, int b) 
{
	  int sum;
	  a = 3;
	  sum = a+b;
	  return(sum);
}

In your main program, you have declared integer variables a and b and given them the values a = 12 and b = 5. You then call the function add(a,b).

What is the return value it returns?

2)
In continuation to the previous question:

What is the value of the variable a in your main program after execution of the function add()?

3)

#include <stdio.h>
int funnyadd(int j, int i);

int main(void)
{
      int i = 5; 
      int j = 7;
      i = funnyadd(i,j);
      printf("%d", i);
      return(0);
}

int funnyadd(int j, int i)
{
      int a = 2;
      return(a*j+i);
}

What is the value of the variable i that is printed out at the end the program?
